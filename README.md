eShapeoko Parts and MakerSlide Accessories
=====

These are the master drawings for custom parts for the eShapeoko CNC milling machine
and for various other projects based on MakerSlide (for example, the camera slider).

Most of them are generally useful MakerSlide accessories, but some parts are designed
specifically for the eShapeoko.

Thank you, Edward!
